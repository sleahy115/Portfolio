    <H2 class="well">About me:</h2>
    <p class="about">I recently completed an AAS in computer information systems from Arapahoe Community College. While completing my studies I worked as a 911 operator for the City of Denver. I really enjoy programming and look forward to working in the field. I decided to enroll in boot camp as a way to immerse myself in the work and build a portfolio. In my free time, I like to read, watch British TV shows, and travel. It is my goal to travel to six of the seven continents and see the seven wonders of the world. So far I have been to four continents, Europe, Africa, South America and North America. I have visited two wonders of the world, Machu Picchu and the Grand Canyon.<span class="color-text"> I am very much looking forward to my next chapter!</span></p>
