  <H2 class="well">About me:</h2>
  <p>I have been exploring my interest in programming for the past 3 years. I have an AAS in computer information systems from Araphoe Community College. While I was going to school I worked as a 911 operator for the City of Denver. I reallying enjoy programming and look forward to working in the field. For fun I like to read, watch British TV shows, and travel. It is my goal to travel to six of the seven continents. So far I have been to four. </p>
